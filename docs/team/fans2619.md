### Project: TeachBook

TeachBook is a desktop app made for primary and secondary school teachers to manage student contacts. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature 1**: Added the ability to switch among classes.
  * What it does: This feature allows users to switch to another class to see the student list of that class and manipulate it (e.g. add student to the class).
  * Justification: This feature is significant to the app because the app is designed in the way that users need to use a command to switch among different classes.

* **New Feature 2**: Added the remark command.
  * What it does: This feature allows users to give any special notes to a student.
  * Justification: This feature improves the usability of the app because a typical user (i.e. teacher) may often want to add a remark to a student, such as the student needs to improve in study.

* **New Feature 3**: Added the function to delete multiple students at once.
  * What it does: This feature allows users to delete multiple students at once, instead of deleting one by one.
  * Justification: This feature improves the usability of the app because it makes the deletion process more flexible for users.
