## What is TeachBook?

TeachBook is a **desktop app for primary and secondary school teachers to manage student contacts, optimized for use via
a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). It is targeted 
towards teachers who can type fast. It allows teachers to store and organise contacts related to their students into 
different classes. On top of that, teachers can tag the class role of the student.

## Features 

<div markdown="block
" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/Jane Doe`.

* The parameter `INDEX` refers to the index number currently shown in the displayed student list, and it must be a positive integer 1, 2, 3, …

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/Joseph Chan t/class monitor` or as `n/Joseph Chan`.

* Items **in** square brackets with `…` after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…` can be used as <code>&nbsp;</code> (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Items **outside** square brackets with `…` after them can be used multiple times but at least once.<br>
  e.g. `INDEX…` can be used as `1`, `2 3`, `1 4 5 9` etc.

* Items separated by `||` means only one of the partitioned items should be supplied.<br>
  e.g. `sort name||grade` can be used as either `sort name` or `sort grade`, but not `sort name grade`.

* If a command accepts more than one parameter (i.e. word in `UPPER_CASE`), parameters can be in any order. However, this does not apply to parameter `INDEX`, which should always be specified before others.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the **last** occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

<a href="#" style="float: right;">[ Back to top ]</a>
### Student related features 
#### Adding a student : `add`

Start organising your classes by adding students! This command allows you to add a new student to the 
currently selected class.

Format: `add n/NAME [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG]…`

* A class must be selected before adding a student.
* Everything is optional except for name of the student.
* You can add multiple tags by adding more `t/` flags.

<div markdown="block
" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Info:**
If you have multiple students with the same name (although unlikely), you can use different capitalization or spacing between first and last name to store the same name!
</div>

<div markdown="block
" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
A student can have any number of tags (including 0)
</div>

Examples:
* `add n/John Doe` adds a student named John Doe into the currently selected class.
* `add n/Jane Doe p/91234567 e/janedoe@example.com a/21 Lower Kent Ridge Road, Singapore 119077 t/class monitor` adds contact information of Jane Doe with all the optional information into the currently selected class.

![add](images/addStudent.png)
Fig 6: `Jane Doe` is added after second command under Examples was executed.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Deleting a student : `delete`

Just in case you have added a student to the wrong class, this command helps you to remove the student from the currently selected class!

Format: `delete INDEX…||all`

* Deletes the student at the specified `INDEX`.

Examples:
* `delete 3` deletes the 3rd student in the TeachBook.
* `list all` followed by `delete 2 3` deletes the 2nd and 3rd students in the TeachBook.
* `find John` followed by `delete 1` deletes the 1st student in the results of the `find` command.
* `select 4E2` followed by `delete all` deletes all the students in class `4E2`.

![delete](images/deleteStudent.png)
Fig 7: `Jane Doe` who was added in [add](#adding-a-student--add), has been removed from the student list after `delete 3` was executed.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Editing a student : `edit`

Any change in students' information can be reflected in the TeachBook using this command to edit students' information accordingly.

Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG]…`

* Edits the student at the specified `INDEX`.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.

<div markdown="block
" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
You can clear a field by omitting the value after the prefix.
</div>

Examples:
* `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` edits the phone number and email address of the 1st student shown in the list to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.
* `edit 3 n/Joseph Chan t/` edits the name of the 3rd student shown in the list to be `Joseph Chan` and clears all existing tags.
* Tags cannot be replaced individually. If the original tag of the first student is `class monitor` and `excellent grade`, calling `edit 1 t/Allergic to seafood`
  will result in the tag being `Allergic to seafood` rather than `class monitor` together with `Allergic to seafood` or `excellent grade` with `Allergic to seafood`.

![edit](images/editStudent.png)
Fig 8: `Jane Doe` who was added in [add](#adding-a-student--add), has been renamed to `Joseph Chan` with no tags after `edit 3 n/Joseph Chan t/` was executed.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Locating students by name : `find`

Scrolling through the whole list of students to find a specific student is often time-consuming. You can use this command to navigate 
directly to the student you are willing to find.

Format: `find KEYWORD…`

* The search is case-insensitive e.g. john, JOHN or JoHn will match John.
* The order of the keywords does not matter e.g. Doe John will match John Doe.
* Only the name is searched.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. John will not match Johnny.
* Students matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. OR search) e.g. John Doe will return John Deer, Jane Doe.

Examples:
* `find Jane Doe` returns only one `Jane Doe` from the currently selected class, even if there is another `Jane Doe` from a different class.
* `list all` followed by `find John Doe` returns two `John Doe`, assuming that there are two `John Doe` in the entire the TeachBook, one from class `4E1` and another one from class `4E2`.

![find](images/findStudent.png)
Fig 9: `Jane Doe` who was added in [add](#adding-a-student--add), is displayed in the student list after `find Jane Doe` was executed.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Adding a remark to a student : `remark`

If there is comments you would like to leave for any students, you can do so with ease with this command.

Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Example:
* `remark 3 r/Contracted COVID-19` adds a remark to the student at index 3 that she has contracted COVID-19.
* `remark 1 r/` clears previously added remark of the student at index 1. 

![remark](images/remark.png)

### Grade related features 
#### Setting a grading system : `setGrade`

TeachBook allows for setting of personalised grading system. You may implement your own grading system
which may differ from semester to semester and subject to subject in order to grade your students accordingly.
Grades are set in descending order, from the highest to the lowest grade.

Format: `setGrade GRADE_1[>GRADE_2]…`

<div markdown="block
" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
This command takes in a list of grades separated by ">" and they are entered in decreasing order!
</div>

Example:
* `setGrade A>B>C>D` sets the grading system where A is the highest grade and F is the lowest grade.

![setGrade](images/setGrade.png)

Fig 11: New grading system added after `setGrade A>B>C>D` was executed.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Giving grade to a student : `grade`

You can use this command to set a grade for a particular student.

Format: `grade INDEX…||all g/[GRADE]`

<div markdown="block
" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
You cannot grade a student without having first add grading system. So, remember to do that first!
</div>

<br>

#### Resetting the grading system : `resetGrade`

Teachbook can only incorporate at most 1 grading system at any time. Therefore, you have to remove any existing
grading system before implementing a new one. This command not only resets the grading system, but also wipes out
all the grades which were previously given to the students.

Format: `resetGrade`

<div markdown="block
" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
All grades will be cleared!
</div>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Attendance related features 
#### Marking the attendance of a student : `mark`

You can use this to mark your student as present. The `present` checkbox will turn green with a tick indicating successful marking of attendance.

Format: `mark INDEX…||all`

<div markdown="block
" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Info:**
This command allows you to mark multiple indexes at once. Which can save you lots of time! The check box will turn green
once the attendance of the student is marked! 
</div>

<div markdown="block
" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Info:**
When using this command this command on a filtered list generated from a `find` command, the list will no longer be filtered and the full list will be shown!
</div>

<div markdown="block
" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
After marking, you can retrieve the attendance list with the `print c/attendance` command. You might also want to check out the [print](#printing-to-excel--print) command for more special columns available to be added.
</div>

Examples:
* `mark 3` marks the student at index 3 as present.
* `mark 2 3 4` marks the students at index 2, 3 and 4 as present.
* `mark all` marks all the students present.
  
![mark](images/markAttendance.png) 
Fig 13: `Jane Doe` who was added in [add](#adding-a-student--add), is displayed with a green checkbox after `mark 3` was executed.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Unmarking the attendance of a student : `unmark`

Just in case you have accidentally marked your student present, you can always unmark them with this command. 
This command also allows you to unmark all the attendance for the selected class so that you can clear your attendance with ease for a new day.

Format: `unmark INDEX…||all`

<div markdown="block
" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Info:**

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<a href="#" style="float: right;">[ Back to top ]</a>
### Utility features 
#### Printing to Excel : `print`

This command generates an Excel file containing students in the currently shown list, with personalised columns as specified in the command parameter.
You can use this command to obtain a physical copy of TeachBook so that you can submit this list to the management if required.

Format: `print [c/class] [c/phone] [c/email] [c/address] [c/tags] [c/remark] [c/attendance] [c/grade] [c/COLUMN_TITLE]…`

* By default, the first column consist of the names of students in the currently shown list.
* You can add one or more empty columns with customized titles.
* Columns with special names mentioned in format will be populated with the respective information from TeachBook.

<div markdown="block
" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Info**
Putting an empty column heading (i.e. `c/ `) will give you an empty column! This can help you have larger separation between columns.
</div>

Examples:
* `print c/class c/email c/Signature` creates an Excel (.xls) file with four columns, student name column, class column, email column, and an empty column with title `Signature`.

![excel](images/img.png)
Fig 15: Excel sheet generated from TeachBook after `print c/class c/email c/Signature` was executed.
<br>

#### Sorting students : `sort`

Unorganised lists are a pain to see. Therefore, TeachBook provides the functionality for you to sort your students either according to their name or grade.

Format: `sort name||grade`

Examples:
* `sort name` sorts the list of students according to their name in alphabetical order.
* `sort grade` sorts the list of students according to their grade in descending order.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Listing all students : `list`

Shows the list of all students from the currently selected class or the entire TeachBook. 
The class name of the student is displayed in the top right corner of each student.

Format: `list [all||absent]`

* `list` lists all students from the currently selected class or the entire TeachBook.
* `list all` lists all students in the TeachBook.
* `list absent` lists all students from the currently selected class or the entire TeachBook whose status is unmarked.

<div markdown="block
" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
`list all` clears any currently selected class. As a result, any command followed by `list all` will be operating on all students in the TeachBook.
</div>
<div markdown="block
" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
`list all` should be interpreted as a way to unselect the currently selected class. Therefore, in order to view the original list after calling 
`list all` followed by other list commands like `list absent`, `list all` won't take you back to the original list
and will be prohibited from calling `list all` as there is already no class selectd. Instead, `list` command should be used to take you back to the original 
list by listing out all the students as no class is selected.
</div>

![list all](images/listAll.png)
